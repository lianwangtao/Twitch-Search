# WebDevTemplate

The goal is to create a template project with modern tools and boilerplate code already setup. Eventually, the commits in this repo could be squashed down into one commit that contains the final template, but for now it will hold all the commits leading up to that.

## Tools

- Yarn
  - Package manager

- Webpack
  - Runs Babel on our code, then bundles front-end files and places it into `/public/bundle.js`.

- Express
  - Used to build a simple server to render static content (found in `/public`) and listens on port `3000` by default.

- ReactJS
  - Allows structuring front-end code with components.

- ESLint
  - Linter tool

## Coming Soon

- Redux
- Hot Module Reloading
- Gulp?
